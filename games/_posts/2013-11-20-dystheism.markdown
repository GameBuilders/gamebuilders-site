Dystheism is a 3D block-based puzzle game written by Jack LaSota. The puzzles are built around 5 different abilities (breaking and summoning blocks, moving them, generating force fields and bombs, throwing fireballs), which can be exchanged midway through them. There are two species of characters (each of which may take any of these abilities), humans and giant spiders. The spiders can walk on walls. Multiple characters can be controlled at once for added complexity. It is currently built for PC/Mac/Linux, and in addition to keyboard control, supports XBox360 and PS3 gamepads. It includes a level editor.

This is a commercial project, so no download link is available here. But alpha access if available to gamebuilders and people I know in real life (email <jack.lasota@gmail.com> to request a download).
