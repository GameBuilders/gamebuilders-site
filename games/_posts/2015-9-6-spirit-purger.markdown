A Bullet Hell Shmup with heavy influences from Touhou Project. Defeat the evil spirit haunting the house. Shoot it down and use bombs to get yourself out of tough situations. Earn the most points by not dying, not using bombs, and getting close to enemy fire without getting hurt. Hold Shift to move slowly and see your own hitbox.

Spirit Purger is the first game that I put significant effort into and completed. The game is written in C#. It went through an engine change from GDI+ to SFML which gave the game many of the features the final version offers.

[Download]({{page.link.Download}}) the game and try it.
