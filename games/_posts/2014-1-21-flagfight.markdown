Flagfight is a game made for the 2013 Global Student Game Developer Competition (GSGDC), an annual 24-hour game jam in which students from all around the world compete. The theme for the competition was to make a game that involved flags. The goal of the game is to beat three enemy AI by scoring 1000 points first. Points can be earned by capturing flags strewn around the map and by attacking enemies at night. There are different game mechanics for night and day (for example, enemies become more aggressive at night and flags only spawn during the day).
