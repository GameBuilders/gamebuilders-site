Volition will be judging this semester's gamebuild-a-thon on Saturday, 11/15! The time/date are still tentative, but as of right now this is likely when it will be. We are working on reserving a space. This semester's gamebuild-a-thon will be 12 hours long and be in Pygame. Stay tuned for the theme of the competition and the full competition details!
